# Ansible Automation
## Introduction 
This repos was created to provide my fellow Sys Admins with a point of reference for creating Ansible playbooks to automate repatative tasks as well as providing a source or human readbale documentation that is easily maintainable. Most of the playbooks that I have published have been tested in both Ansible core and Ansible Tower environments. Each one of the directories is structured to also provide you with the means to create a stable execution environment with the ansible-builder tool. That way you can create a run environment with all the depenancies needed to run these playbooks. If you like it. Please fork it. 

## Directories
### Password Rotate
This directory conatis a playbook and instructions to change the root password on you systems and to safely generate push ssh key-pairs using rsa encryption. Please review the README.md file contained in this directory for further instructions.
